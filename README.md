# Algorithms_Basic
I came across some algorithm problems and I try to solve them in this repository. Separate from  my usual course, I will take some time to solve these. I will link the source of these problems and try to solve them in as many languages as possible with the first one being C. 

I will also put a time limit for myself for the solving these problems in the first language (C): before or on 25-04-2023.
Keep track of my commits to see if I made it to my deadline or not.

“I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and the impossible.”

― Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche

I hope to follow this ideology when I attempt these problems.
